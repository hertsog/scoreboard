# scoreboard
Simple basketball scoreboard emulation software written in pascal and Lazarus IDE. Designed to run on computer with two monitors where one is for user control panel and the other is used as scoreboard.

Currently works only under Windows since it uses Windows API to load a font directly from file. Should work under other OSes when the font is installed in OS and doesn't have to be loaded directly from file. Also plays buzzer sound using Windows API.
